# GenAI Approach for Detection of Depression | AI & Data Science

An academic **AI-powered emotion detection system** built using **Machine Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, and Generative AI**, designed to identify **depression, anxiety, stress, and frustration** and generate **empathetic, context-aware responses**.

This project was developed as a **Final Year B.Tech (CSE) College Project**, with a strong focus on **mental wellness, ethical AI, and real-time emotion-aware interaction**.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Mental health challenges such as **depression, anxiety, and emotional distress** are becoming increasingly common among students and working professionals. However, access to immediate emotional support is often limited.

Most existing AI systems:
- Lack **emotional awareness**
- Provide **generic or robotic responses**
- Fail to detect **high-risk emotional situations**

The objective of this project is to design an **emotion-aware AI system** that can analyze user inputs, detect emotional states, and respond in a **supportive, ethical, and non-diagnostic manner**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To design and implement a **multimodal AI system** capable of:

- Detecting emotional states such as **Depression, Anxiety, Stress, and Frustration**
- Analyzing **text-based emotional cues**
- Identifying **crisis situations** using rule-based logic
- Generating **empathetic responses** using Generative AI
- Supporting **early emotional awareness**, not medical diagnosis

---

## 🖥️ System Overview

The system follows a **multi-layered, multimodal architecture** designed to capture, analyze, and respond to human emotional states in real time:

- **Input Layer:**  
  Multi-modal data capture using **real-time webcam feed (facial expressions)** and **user text input**.

- **Emotion Detection Layer:**  
  - Computer Vision–based facial emotion recognition using a CNN model  
  - NLP-based emotion classification from textual input

- **Crisis Detection Layer:**  
  Rule-based logic combined with model confidence scores to identify **high-risk emotional states**.

- **Response Generation Layer:**  
  Generative AI–based **empathetic and context-aware response generation**.

- **Backend Layer:**  
  API-driven processing, inference orchestration, and logging.
