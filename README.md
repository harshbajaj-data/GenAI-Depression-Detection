## 🧩 Problem Statement

Mental health challenges such as **depression, anxiety, and emotional distress** are becoming increasingly common among students and working professionals. However, access to immediate emotional support is often limited.

Most existing AI systems:
- Lack **emotional awareness**
- Provide **generic or robotic responses**
- Fail to detect **high-risk emotional situations**

The objective of this project is to design an **emotion-aware AI system** that can analyze user inputs, detect emotional states, and respond in a **supportive, ethical, and non-diagnostic manner**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To design and implement a **multimodal AI system** capable of:

- Detecting emotional states such as **Depression, Anxiety, Stress, and Frustration**
- Analyzing **text-based emotional cues**
- Identifying **crisis situations** using rule-based logic
- Generating **empathetic responses** using Generative AI
- Supporting **early emotional awareness**, not medical diagnosis

---

## 🖥️ System Overview

The system follows a layered architecture:

- **Input Layer:** User text input
- **Emotion Detection Layer:** NLP-based emotion classification
- **Crisis Detection Layer:** Keyword and severity-based intervention logic
- **Response Layer:** Generative AI-based empathetic responses
- **Backend Layer:** API processing and logging
